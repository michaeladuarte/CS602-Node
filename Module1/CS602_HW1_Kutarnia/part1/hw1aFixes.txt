This issue is caused by the fact that the variables in the JS hold a reference to the actual object itself in the data array. 
So when we created the variable reference and changed the name in the variable, it actually changed it in the data array.
In order to prevent this issue from occuring, you can instantiate and return a new 'employee' JSON object like I did in the function
assigned to the variable v4 in employeeModule_v1.
